Shalmali Joshi is an `Assistant Professor` at [Columbia University, Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) where she leads the `reAIM Lab`. She works to advance Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods with the goal of advancing clinical health and medicine for all.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, if done right, have a huge potential for transforming health, medicine and improving health equity. `reAIM's` mission is to `refocus` methodological developments in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to make ML/AI reliable and safe for health, medicine, and improve health inequities along the way.

Our group develops methods using causal inference, off-policy reinforcement learning, and other advanced deep and machine learning, combined with an in-depth understanding of the clinical problem to develop safe, robust, generalizable learning-based solutions.
